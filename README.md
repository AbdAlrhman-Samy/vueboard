## TODO

I consider this project to be finished, but there are still some things that I would like to add or improve:

- [ ] Clean up the data fetching logic
- [ ] Add more filtering options in Users, Products and Orders pages
- [ ] Split the code into smaller components, like the Delete Modal
- [ ] Better folder structure (?)
- [ ] Add Dark Mode (with vueUse?)
